# Pure

> Pretty, minimal and fast ZSH prompt

<img src="screenshot.png" width="864">


## Overview

Most prompts are cluttered, ugly and slow. I wanted something visually pleasing that stayed out of my way.

### Why?

- Comes with the perfect prompt character.
  Author went through the whole Unicode range to find it.
- Shows `git` branch and whether it's dirty (with a `*`).
- Indicates when you have unpushed/unpulled `git` commits with up/down arrows. *(Check is done asynchronously!)*
- Prompt character turns red if the last command didn't exit with `0`.
- Command execution time will be displayed if it exceeds the set threshold.
- Username and host only displayed when in an SSH session.
- Shows the current path in the title and the [current folder & command](screenshot-title-cmd.png) when a process is running.
- Support VI-mode indication by reverse prompt symbol (Zsh 5.3+).
- Makes an excellent starting point for your own custom prompt.


## Install

Can be installed with `npm` or manually. Requires Git 2.0.0+ and ZSH 5.2+. Older versions of ZSH are known to work, but they are **not** recommended.

### npm

```console
$ npm install --global pure-prompt
```

That's it. Skip to [Getting started](#getting-started).

### Manually

1. Either…
  - Clone this repo
  - add it as a submodule, or
  - just download [`pure.zsh`](pure.zsh) and [`async.zsh`](async.zsh)

2. Symlink `pure.zsh` to somewhere in [`$fpath`](https://www.refining-linux.org/archives/46-ZSH-Gem-12-Autoloading-functions.html) with the name `prompt_pure_setup`.

3. Symlink `async.zsh` in `$fpath` with the name `async`.

#### Example

```console
$ ln -s "$PWD/pure.zsh" /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/prompt_pure_setup
$ ln -s "$PWD/async.zsh" /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/async
```
*Run `echo $fpath` to see possible locations.*

For a user-specific installation (which would not require escalated privileges), simply add a directory to `$fpath` for that user:

```sh
# .zshenv or .zshrc
fpath=( "$HOME/.zfunctions" $fpath )
```

Then install the theme there:

```console
$ ln -s "$PWD/pure.zsh" "$HOME/.zfunctions/prompt_pure_setup"
$ ln -s "$PWD/async.zsh" "$HOME/.zfunctions/async"
```


## Getting started

Initialize the prompt system (if not so already) and choose `pure`:

```sh
# .zshrc
autoload -U promptinit; promptinit
prompt pure
```


## Options

| :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |

| **`PURE_GIT_PULL=0`**            | Prevents Pure from checking whether the current Git remote has been updated.                   |                |
| **`PURE_GIT_UNTRACKED_DIRTY=0`** | Do not include untracked files in dirtiness check. Mostly useful on large repos (like WebKit). |                |
| **`PURE_GIT_DELAY_DIRTY_CHECK`** | Time in seconds to delay git dirty checking when `git status` takes > 5 seconds.               | `1800` seconds |
| **`PURE_PROMPT_SYMBOL`**         | Defines the prompt symbol.                                                                     | `❯`            |
| **`PURE_PROMPT_VICMD_SYMBOL`**   | Defines the prompt symbol used when the `vicmd` keymap is active (VI-mode).                    | `❮`            |
| **`PURE_GIT_DOWN_ARROW`**        | Defines the git down arrow symbol.                                                             | `⇣`            |
| **`PURE_GIT_UP_ARROW`**          | Defines the git up arrow symbol.                                                               | `⇡`            |

## Example

```sh
# .zshrc

autoload -U promptinit; promptinit

# optionally define some options
PURE_CMD_MAX_EXEC_TIME=10

prompt pure
```


## Tips

In the screenshot you see Pure running in [Hyper](https://hyper.is) with the [hyper-snazzy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/hyper-snazzy) theme and Menlo font.

The [Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) theme with the [Droid Sans Mono](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/droid-sans-mono) font (15pt) is also a [nice combination](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure/blob/95ee3e7618c6e2162a1e3cdac2a88a20ac3beb27/screenshot.png).<br>
*Just make sure you have anti-aliasing enabled in your terminal.*

To have commands colorized as seen in the screenshot, install [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting).


## Integration

### [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

1. Set `ZSH_THEME=""` in your `.zshrc` to disable oh-my-zsh themes.
2. Follow the Pure [Install](#install) instructions.
3. Do not enable the following (incompatible) plugins: `vi-mode`, `virtualenv`.

**NOTE:** `oh-my-zsh` overrides the prompt so Pure must be activated *after* `source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh`.

### [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

Pure is bundled with Prezto. No need to install it.

Add `prompt pure` to your `~/.zpreztorc`.

Pure is bundled with Zim. No need to install it.

Set `zprompt_theme='pure'` in `~/.zimrc`.

### [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

```sh
antigen bundle mafredri/zsh-async
antigen bundle sindresorhus/pure
