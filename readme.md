# Pure

> Pretty, minimal and fast ZSH prompt

![screenshot](screenshot.png)


## Overview

Most prompts are cluttered, ugly and slow. I wanted something visually pleasing that stayed out of my way.

### Why?

- Comes with the perfect prompt character. Author went through the whole Unicode range to find it.
- Shows git branch and whether it's dirty using the [fastest](https://gist.github.com/3898739) method available.
- Prompt character turns red if the last command didn't exit with 0.
- Command execution time will be displayed if it exceeds the set threshold.
- Username and host is only displayed when in an SSH session.
- Shows the current path in the title and the [current directory and command](screenshot-title-cmd.png) when a process is running.
- Can easily be used as a starting point for your own custom prompt.


## Getting started

- Place this file somewhere in `$fpath` with the name `prompt_pure_setup`

For example:

```
$ sudo cp ./pure.zsh /usr/share/zsh/functions/Prompts/prompt_pure_setup
```

- Initialize the prompt system (if not so already):

```sh
# .zshrc
autoload -U promptinit
promptinit
```

- Choose this prompt:

```sh
# .zshrc
prompt pure
```


## Options

### `PURE_CMD_MAX_EXEC_TIME`

The max execution time of a process before its run time is shown when it exits. Defaults to `5` seconds.


## Example

```sh
# .zshrc

# optionally define some options
PURE_CMD_MAX_EXEC_TIME=10

prompt pure
```


## Tip

[Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) theme with the [Droid Sans Mono](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono) font (15pt) is a beautiful combination, as seen in the screenshot above.
